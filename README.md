StimulationB15
Description

StimulationB15 is a project aimed at controlling multiple hardware devices such as cameras and LEDs for the purpose of scientific experimentation. It provides capabilities for signal synchronization, camera control, LED pattern generation, data logging, and a graphical user interface for easier operation.
Features

    Camera Control: For capturing video or images from multiple synchronized cameras.
    TTL Signals: To synchronize different hardware components.
    LED Patterns: For generating custom LED sequences.
    GUI Interface: For easy control and configuration of experiments.
    Data Logging: To save and manage experimental data.
